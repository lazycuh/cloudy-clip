</header>

<section id="introduction">
    <h3 i18n>1. Introduction to Cloudy Clip Terms of Service</h3>
    <p i18n>
        This document establishes a legally binding agreement between Cloudy Clip (referred to as "we," "us," or
        "our") and the user ("you" or "user") governing the access to and use of the Cloudy Clip application and its
        services. The primary function of Cloudy Clip is to provide a platform exclusively for trade journaling. By
        using this application, you agree to adhere to the terms and conditions outlined herein. The agreement becomes
        effective immediately upon your initial use of the application . It is important to understand that these terms
        apply to all features and functionalities currently available within the Cloudy Clip application and any
        future updates or additions, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        As the Cloudy Clip application evolves, it may become necessary to modify these Terms of Service. We
        expressly reserve the right to change these terms from time to time without providing direct notice to you. You
        acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to periodically review this document to familiarize
        yourself with any modifications. Your continued use of the Cloudy Clip application after any such
        modifications will constitute an acknowledgement of the updated Terms of Service and an agreement to be bound by
        them . This ensures that the terms remain relevant and applicable to the application's current state and any
        changes in legal or regulatory requirements.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="acceptance-of-terms">
    <h3 i18n>2. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p i18n>
        By accessing or using the Cloudy Clip application, you unequivocally acknowledge that you have carefully
        read, fully understood, and willingly agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy . This
        agreement governs your relationship with Cloudy Clip and outlines the rules and regulations for using our
        services. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must immediately cease all access to and use of
        the application . This condition is fundamental to your right to use the application, as it ensures a mutual
        understanding and acceptance of the terms that govern the platform.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        Consideration should be given to including an age restriction for using the Cloudy Clip application. While
        the application focuses on trade journaling and does not directly involve financial transactions, users will be
        inputting their trading data, which may have financial implications. Establishing a minimum age, such as 18
        years or older, as suggested in other terms of service examples, could be a prudent measure. This can help
        ensure that users are of legal age to make their own decisions regarding financial matters and to understand the
        implications of the data they are recording within the application.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="description-of-service">
    <h3 i18n>3. Description of Service: Trade Journaling</h3>
    <p i18n>
        The core functionality of the Cloudy Clip application is to provide a dedicated platform for users to engage
        in comprehensive trade journaling. This involves the ability to meticulously record various details related to
        individual trades, such as entry and exit prices, dates, precise times of execution, the specific symbols or
        assets traded, and the size or quantity of the positions taken. Furthermore, the application allows users to add
        detailed notes and personal observations about each trade, capturing the rationale behind the decisions,
        emotional states during the trade, and any relevant market context. The application may also offer basic
        performance tracking metrics derived from the entered data, providing users with a high-level overview of their
        trading activities.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        It is crucial to explicitly state that Cloudy Clip does not offer several services that might be associated
        with broader trading platforms. For clarity, Cloudy Clip does not provide any form of trading advice,
        financial recommendations, or signals. The application does not facilitate the execution of trades, nor does it
        directly connect to users' brokerage accounts for automated data import or any other purpose. Features such as
        backtesting trading strategies or replaying past trades are not part of the Cloudy Clip service. This clear
        distinction ensures that users have accurate expectations about the scope of services provided.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        Cloudy Clip reserves the sole and absolute right to modify, temporarily suspend, or permanently discontinue
        the application, or any specific feature or part thereof, at any time. This can be done with or without prior
        notice to users. Such actions may be necessary for various reasons, including but not limited to performing
        maintenance, implementing updates, addressing security concerns, or making strategic business decisions. Trade
        Timeline will not be held liable to you or any third party for any loss or inconvenience resulting from any such
        modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the application or its features. This provision ensures
        operational flexibility for Cloudy Clip to adapt and evolve over time.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="user-accounts">
    <h3 i18n>4. User Accounts</h3>
    <p i18n>
        To access and utilize the full range of services offered by the Cloudy Clip application, users will be
        required to create a personal account. The registration process will involve providing a valid email address,
        creating a secure password. As part of the registration process, users may be asked to complete an online
        registration form that requests certain information and data. It is imperative that all information provided
        during registration is truthful, accurate, and kept current. Users are responsible for maintaining and promptly
        updating their registration data to ensure it remains complete and accurate at all times. This ensures the
        integrity of user data within the application and facilitates effective account management.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        Maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account credentials, including your username and password,
        is your sole responsibility. You are entirely responsible for all activities that occur under your account,
        regardless of whether you authorized them. This includes any actions taken, data entered, or modifications made
        within the application using your credentials. Should you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of
        your account, or any other breach of security, you must immediately notify Cloudy Clip. This prompt
        notification allows us to take appropriate measures to help secure your account and mitigate any potential
        risks.
    </p>
    <!-- <p i18n>
        Users may have the option to terminate their Cloudy Clip account at any time. The specific procedure for
        account termination, if available, will be clearly outlined within the application's settings or help
        documentation. Upon termination, your access to the Cloudy Clip application and your account will be revoked.
        Consideration should be given to whether users will have the ability to export their trade journal data prior to
        or upon termination, as this is a common expectation for data-centric applications.
    </p> -->
</section>

<section id="user-conduct">
    <h3 i18n>5. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h3>
    <p i18n>
        Users are expected to utilize the Cloudy Clip application in a responsible and ethical manner, primarily for
        the intended purpose of personal trade journaling. This includes using the application in compliance with all
        applicable laws and regulations.

        abusive behavior, or hate speech towards other users (if community features are introduced in the future) is
        strictly forbidden. Furthermore, users must not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of Cloudy Clip
        or any third parties. Any attempts to spam other users or post irrelevant, misleading, or malicious content (if
        sharing features are added later) are also prohibited.

    <p i18n>
        Users bear full responsibility for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of all data they input into their
        trade journals within the Cloudy Clip application. Cloudy Clip serves as a tool for recording and
        organizing this data, but it does not endorse, verify, or take any responsibility for the content of individual
        user journals. The insights and analysis derived from the journaled data are solely the user's responsibility.

        journal entries). These elements are protected by applicable intellectual property laws, including copyright and

    <p i18n>
        Users retain full ownership of the data they personally enter into their trade journals within the Trade
        Timeline application. However, by using the application, users grant Cloudy Clip a non-exclusive,
        royalty-free, worldwide license to access, use, store, electronically copy, transmit, display, and process this
        data solely for the purpose of providing the trade journaling service to the user and as otherwise outlined in
        the Privacy Policy. This license is necessary for the application to function as intended and to allow Trade
        Timeline to store and manage user data.

        property rights. This includes, but is not limited to, copying, modifying, distributing, selling, leasing, or
        creating derivative works based on the Cloudy Clip application or its underlying code, in whole or in part,
        without the express prior written permission from Cloudy Clip. Reverse engineering, decompiling, or otherwise
        attempting to extract the source code of the application is also strictly prohibited, except to the extent
        expressly permitted by applicable law.

    <h3 i18n>7. Data Privacy and Security</h3>

    <p i18n>
        The collection, use, and disclosure of users' personal information by Cloudy Clip are governed by a
        comprehensive Privacy Policy. This policy is a separate document that provides detailed information about the
        types of personal data we collect, how we collect it, the purposes for which we use it, and the circumstances
        under which we may disclose it. The Privacy Policy also outlines the measures we take to protect user data and
        the rights users have regarding their personal information. It is essential that you review the Privacy Policy
        to understand our practices concerning your data.
    </p>

    <p i18n>
        Cloudy Clip implements reasonable and appropriate security measures designed to protect user data from
        unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures may include encryption of data in transit
        and at rest, secure server infrastructure, access controls, and regular security audits. While we strive to
        protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage
        is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
    <p i18n>
        Users also have a crucial role to play in maintaining the security of their own data. As previously mentioned,
        users are responsible for safeguarding their account credentials, using strong and unique passwords, and
        protecting their devices from unauthorized access. Cloudy Clip will not be held responsible for data breaches
        or unauthorized access resulting from a user's failure to maintain adequate security measures on their end.
