This condition is fundamental to your right to use the application, as it ensures a mutual understanding and acceptance of the terms that govern the platform.",
    "4602107000931343217": "Consideration should be given to including an age restriction for using the Cloudy Clip application. While the application focuses on trade journaling and does not directly involve financial transactions, users will be inputting their trading data, which may have financial implications. Establishing a minimum age, such as 18 years or older, as suggested in other terms of service examples, could be a prudent measure.
